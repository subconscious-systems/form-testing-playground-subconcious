Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual OpenAI API key.
You can get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Note: The .env file is already in .gitignore, so it won't be committed to version control.
